This is a set of analysis tools to be used in CMB research. It currently consists of code to calculate the pure Cl power spectra from a HEALPix map along with the associated mode-mixing matrices. In addition it contains a port of polspice to Python. Finally, we have added code to calculate the COBE Quadcube pixel number given an input position on the sky.

## Requirements ##

There are several Python modules needed in order to run this code. They are

* Numpy
* Scipy
* Astropy
* Healpy
* Mpi4py

In addition, the location of the cmb_analysis directory needs to be added to your PYTHONPATH environment variable.
